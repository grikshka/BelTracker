Things that went wrong:

- communication between members


Things that we improved on:

- we finished everything we planned - we created smaller user stories that were easier to manage and we better estimated our time
- we were really good prepared for the sprint - we prepared really good plan for sprint and all of us had paper with presentation plan and everything went as expected.
- we said thank you at the end and we presented ourselves better as well
